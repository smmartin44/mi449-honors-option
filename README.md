## Outline of Pages for Coffee Shop Website

1. **Homepage**: This will be the default page for the website, where the user is greeted
with a navigation bar across the top of the site. On the homepage will be the name of the business,
some initial pictures that go along with it, and a brief summary of the coffee site.

2. **About the Business**: This will contain the "history" of the company, it's location of the shops,
fun facts about the owners (which in this case will be me), and our mission.

3. **Menu**: The menu will include drinks and food items that are offered at the shop, including
images, prices, and descriptions.

4. **Shop**: This will act as a "gift shop" of sorts for the coffee shop. Mostly selling our coffee beans,
mugs and other merchandise, and gift cards. It will include descriptions, images, and prices. Plus any
alerts for sales.

5. **Contact**: This page will have the names of the owner (aka me), a fake address and phone number
for contact information.

## Possible Components
- **Header/Navigation Bar**: As mentioned on the homepage portion, I want to have a navigation bar for the
website, and have that as part of the header with a logo, business name, and tabs/links to the other pages. This
will most likely be in the form of a component so I can reuse it on all my pages.
- **Footer**: Include links to social media, logo, links to other locations of the shop.
- **Shop Items**: Instead of having to individually develop each item in the shop, I can create "shop item" 
component so I can just pass in the specific data for that item, but the component will already be created.
Will avoid repetition.
- **Menu Item**: Same goes for the menu items - each item will have a name, image, price, description, all in
the same format so it would work well for a component.

### To-Do Notes for 2/10
- Write code for the 5 separate page outlines, get familiar with React
- Create component for header/navbar, footer
- Create light wireframes for future development
